Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System developed using Python and Flask, designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on content similarity. It uses machine learning and NLP techniques to analyze movie metadata and recommend similar titles to users.

 Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on genres, cast, keywords, overview, and more.

Real-Time Web Interface: Built using Flask for an interactive movie search and recommendation experience.

Similarity Search: Uses text vectorization and KNN to find and rank similar movies.

Machine Learning Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Dataset Used: TMDB Movie Dataset (from Kaggle).

Cleaned null values, standardized movie metadata, removed duplicates.

Used Pandarallel for parallel processing to speed up data preparation.

Feature Engineering
Extracted important features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

Combined features into a single textual field.

Applied SpaCy and NLP techniques for advanced text cleaning and tokenization.

Similarity Calculation
Vectorized text data using TF-IDF.

Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to calculate movie similarity.

Created a similarity matrix for efficient recommendations.

Deployment
Integrated the model into a Flask web app.

Designed a clean UI for users to input a movie and receive top 5 recommendations instantly.

Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Web Framework: Flask

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Pandarallel, Scikit-learn, SpaCy

ML Techniques: TF-IDF Vectorizer, KNN Algorithm

Deployment: Flask-based Web App
